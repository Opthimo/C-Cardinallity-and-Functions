# Cardinality, Functions and Datatypes

## 1) Introduction
> 🧮 Understanding the size of sets helps us reason about the behavior of functions in programming.

In mathematics, the **cardinality** (or **mächtigkeit**) of a set describes how many elements it contains:
- `|{1,2,3}| = 3`
- `|ℕ| = ℵ₀` (countably infinite)
- `|ℝ| > ℵ₀` (uncountably infinite)

In C, every **datatype** defines a set of possible values — and those sets are always **finite**.

For example:
- `char` uses 8 bits → `|char| = 2^8 = 256`
- `int` uses 32 bits → `|int| = 2^32 = 4,294,967,296`
- `bool` is conceptually just `|bool| = 2`

This gives us a tool to reason about **functions**:
```c
int add(int a, int b);
```
is a function from:
```
int × int → int
```
with:
- input space: `2^32 × 2^32 = 2^64`
- output space: `2^32`

This means: the function cannot be injective — different inputs may yield the same output.

Remember: Every C [function](https://github.com/STEMgraph/0b6b3ce8-418e-4900-ae42-a6d068389a12) defines a mapping from the [Cartesian product](https://github.com/STEMgraph/e954e47f-3d9d-4707-bea3-1ef3105278f4) of its parameter types to its return type.

## 2) Tasks
1. **Count Values**: For the following types, compute the number of possible values:
   - `uint8_t`  - 2^8    = 255
   - `int16_t`  - 2^16   = 65.536
   - `bool`     - 2^1    = 2
   - `float` (estimate based on IEEE 754, not exact) 2^32 - 4.294.967.296

2. **Function Domains**: Write a function `bool is_zero(uint8_t x);` and describe the cardinality of its input- and output-sets.

output 2^1 input 2^8

3. **Write a Surjective Function**: Write a function `bool parity(uint8_t x);` that maps even numbers to `0`, odd to `1`. Is this function surjective?

4. **Write a Constant Function**: Write a function `int always_five(float x);` that ignores the input. Argue about its injectivity and surjectivity.

5. **Collision Observation**: Write a function `uint8_t compress(uint32_t x);`. Try calling it with two different values.

## 3) Questions
1. What does it mean for a function to be injective, surjective, bijective?
2. Can a function in C be truly bijective if the domain is larger than the codomain?
3. Why do collisions matter in hashing?
4. What’s the difference between a function that *ignores* its argument and one that *uses* it partially?
5. How does knowing the cardinality of types help in optimizing or verifying code?

## 4) Advice
Use `sizeof(type)` and `<stdint.h>` types to make reasoning about value ranges easier. When debugging unexpected results, ask yourself: *how many inputs exist, and how many outputs are possible?* This can lead directly to understanding bugs in conversions, hashing, or logic.
